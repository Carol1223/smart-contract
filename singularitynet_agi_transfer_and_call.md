Function Code:

```solidity
function transferAndCall(address to, uint256 value, bytes data) public returns (bool) {
    require(transfer(to, value));
    require(isContract(to));
    ContractReceiver receiver = ContractReceiver(to);
    require(receiver.tokenFallback(msg.sender, value, data));
    return true;
}
```

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `call`

Explanation

Purpose:
The `transferAndCall` function is designed to facilitate the transfer of AGI tokens from one user to another while also calling a function on the receiving contract. This is useful in scenarios where additional logic needs to be executed on the receiving end immediately after a token transfer.

Detailed Usage:
- Token Transfer: The function first calls the `transfer` function to move `value` tokens from the sender to the receiver.
- Contract Check: It then checks if the `to` address is a contract by calling the `isContract` function.
- Fallback Execution: If the recipient is a contract, it creates an instance of the `ContractReceiver` interface and calls the `tokenFallback` function on the receiving contract, passing the sender's address, the value of tokens transferred, and any additional data as arguments.

The `call` method is implicitly used when the `tokenFallback` function is invoked. This ensures that the receiving contract can handle the incoming tokens and any associated data appropriately.

Impact:
The `transferAndCall` function enhances the AGI token's utility by enabling interactions with other smart contracts directly during a token transfer. This can be particularly useful for integrating AI services on the SingularityNET platform, where token transfers can trigger specific actions or functions within AI service contracts. It adds a layer of interactivity and programmability, making the token more versatile and functional within the ecosystem.
